# PyBank
  In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called     budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
  
  I had to show the following:
  ·The total number of months included in the dataset
  ·The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  ·Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  ·The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  ·The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
